Okay, thank you! The Dockerfile looks mostly correct, and the logs provide the crucial clue.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Dockerfile Order:** You have the steps in a logical sequence: install system dependencies, copy package files, run `npm install`, *then* run `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome`, and finally copy the rest of the app code. **However, there's a subtle but critical issue:**
    *   You copy `package*.json`.
    *   You run `npm install`.
    *   You run `RUN npx puppeteer browsers install chrome`.
    *   **Then** you run `COPY . .`, which copies your `.puppeteerrc.cjs` file.
    *   This means the `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome` command runs **BEFORE** the `.puppeteerrc.cjs` configuration file exists in the `/app` directory within the Docker build context. Therefore, that install command doesn't know about your `cacheDirectory: join(__dirname, '.cache', 'puppeteer')` setting and likely tried to install Chrome to the default location (like `/root/.cache/puppeteer` inside the build container), not `/app/.cache/puppeteer`.

2.  **Build Logs & Caching:** The most important lines in your logs are:
    ```
    #9 CACHED
    #9 [5/7] RUN npm install --production --ignore-scripts
    #8 CACHED
    #8 [6/7] RUN npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
    #13 CACHED
    #13 [7/7] COPY . .
    ```
    The `CACHED` keyword means that Render/Docker determined that these layers haven't changed since the last *successful* build and reused the cached layer instead of re-running the commands. This is usually good for speed, but **it means the `RUN npx puppeteer browsers install chrome` command likely didn't even execute in this specific build you pasted logs from.** It's reusing a previous layer where Chrome was either not installed or installed incorrectly (due to the config file not being present yet).

**Solution:**

1.  **Fix Dockerfile Order:** You need to copy the Puppeteer configuration file *before* you run the browser install command.

    ```dockerfile
    # Use the official Node.js LTS image
    FROM node:20-slim

    # Install necessary dependencies for Chromium
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        wget \
        ca-certificates \
        fonts-liberation \
        libasound2 \
        libatk-bridge2.0-0 \
        libatk1.0-0 \
        libcups2 \
        libdbus-1-3 \
        libdrm2 \
        libgbm1 \
        libgtk-3-0 \
        libnspr4 \
        libnss3 \
        libxcomposite1 \
        libxdamage1 \
        libxrandr2 \
        xdg-utils \
        --no-install-recommends && \
        rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy configuration files and package files FIRST
    COPY package*.json ./
    COPY .puppeteerrc.cjs ./   # <--- COPY CONFIG FILE HERE

    # Install Node dependencies (no postinstall now)
    RUN npm install --production --ignore-scripts

    # Explicitly download Chrome for Puppeteer (now respects .puppeteerrc.cjs)
    RUN npx puppeteer browsers install chrome

    # Copy the rest of your app
    COPY . .

    # Expose the port (matches your Express app)
    EXPOSE 8787

    # Start the app
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```

2.  **Clear Build Cache on Render:** Because the previous steps were cached, simply deploying again might *still* use the cache. You need to force Render to rebuild everything without the cache.
    *   Go to your Service on Render.
    *   Find the "Manual Deploy" button.
    *   Click the dropdown arrow next to it and select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**.

**Why this should work:**

*   By copying `.puppeteerrc.cjs` before `RUN npx puppeteer browsers install chrome`, the installation command will correctly read the configuration and know to download Chrome into `/app/.cache/puppeteer`.
*   By clearing the build cache, you ensure the `RUN npx puppeteer browsers install chrome` command actually executes instead of being skipped due to caching.

After deploying with the corrected Dockerfile and cleared cache, check the **new build logs**. You should now see output from the `RUN npx puppeteer browsers install chrome` step indicating the download and installation process. If that step completes successfully in the build logs, your runtime error should be resolved.
