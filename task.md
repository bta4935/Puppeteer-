# 3. Plan Groq API Integration
Research Groq’s API for text-to-Markdown conversion (likely via a language model endpoint).
Add a utility/service function to your backend to call the Groq API, handling authentication and errors.

# 4. Update the Selector Endpoint
After extracting text, call the Groq API for each selector’s text.
Add the Markdown result to your API response, so each selector returns both the original text and its Markdown version.

# 5. Update Documentation
Document the new response structure (now includes Markdown).
Add instructions for setting up any required environment variables (like Groq API keys).
Explain the new feature to users/developers.

# 6. Test the New Feature
Test with various selectors to ensure Markdown output is correct.
Handle and test error cases (e.g., Groq API errors).
Verify both the original text and Markdown are returned as expected.

# 7. Deploy and Monitor
Deploy the updated service.
Ensure Groq API keys are configured in the environment.
Monitor for errors or performance issues.
Notify users about the new Markdown feature.



# 1. Locate Groq API Documentation
Search for Groq's official API documentation.
Focus on endpoints that allow sending a prompt and receiving a language model response (text transformation).

## Groq API information: 
- model: meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
- api key: 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
- prompt: 
  - convert the text into clean markdown following markdown best practices for llm:
    - start Headings with #
    - proper spacing for readability
  - **Output only the content**
- endpoint: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

- curl example:
```
curl https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions -s \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
-d '{
"model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
"messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models"
}]
}'
```

# 2. Identify Endpoint and Prompt Format
Review how to structure the request body: you will send the selector's extracted text as a prompt with instructions to convert it to Markdown.

# 3. Understand Authentication and Environment Variables
Confirm that an API key is required for Groq.
Note the standard way to include the API key (usually via the Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY> header).
For best practice with Render, plan to set the API key as an environment variable (e.g., GROQ_API_KEY) in the Render dashboard, not hard-coded in your codebase.

# 4. Review Request/Response Structure
Document the required fields for the request (e.g., model, messages, etc.).
Note the response structure: where to find the Markdown output in the response JSON.
Identify how errors are returned so you can handle them gracefully.

# 5. Production Best Practices with Render
Set the Groq API key as a secret environment variable in Render's dashboard.
Never commit secrets to your codebase.
Plan for rate limits and error logging.
Consider retries or fallbacks for API failures.

# 6. Summarize and Document
Write a summary of the above steps for your team or future reference.
Include example request/response payloads and instructions for setting up the environment variable on Render.
If you want, I can scaffold the code for Groq API integration next, or provide example environment variable setup instructions for Render. Just let me know your preference!
